# Cube Projection

Transforms a matrix of 3D Cube coordinates with Eigen3 and visualizes the results with SDL2

## Requirements
- Eigen3
- SDL2

### Ubuntu Linux / WSL
`sudo apt install libeigen3-dev libsdl2-dev`

### macOS (Homebrew)
`brew install eigen3 sdl2`

## Building and Running
Just run `make` and execute `./cube-projection`. If you're having issues, make sure you have the right dependencies. Or maybe your compiler searches for the dependencies in different places in different operating systems.
